# DFS-Research-Automation

This is a personal project of mines that automates my research workflow for a day of Daily Fantasy Sports Research. What would take hours to do manually now takes only moments. 
It scrapes relevant data, such as starting pitchers, lineups, schedules, stats, and more from various web pages and public APIs and processes the data to generate a final Excel file containing player data and an analysis of each matchup.

It also is able to take a modified version of that resulting Excel file, containing player selections made by me upon review of the matchup data, and generate a desired amount lineups for Fanduel. These lineups are roughly evenly distributed by the dominant stack of each lineup.
